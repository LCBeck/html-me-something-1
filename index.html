				<h1>Providence Indeed!</h1>
				<img src="images/bag.jpg" alt="Front Bag" />
				<p>Walking the streets of downtown Providence... my regular coder meetup.</p>
    				<p>The air is cool ... splendor in the fall!</p>
    				<p>Hungry, I turn to a young man: "Do you know any decent bagel joints 'round here?" ... he smiles.</p>
    				<p>"Do I???" he boisterously responds to my question... He directs me.</p>
    				<p>A tall & thin gentleman ... almost gaunt.</p>
    				<p>Blonde beard, thick rim glasses, black ear studs ... hip!</p>
    				<p>He's struggling to carry three large duffle bags ... odd!</p>
    				<p>"Oh hey man, do you like coffee?" ... ???</p>
    				<p>I reply in the affirmative ... he opens his luggage.</p>
    				<p>"Here take this!" and so I do ... he was in town for the coffee convention.</p>
				<p>Providence indeed my Lord ... Providence indeed!!!</p>
